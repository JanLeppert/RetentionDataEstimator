[x] test automatic differentiation with ODE-solutions
[x] what to do about phi_0 and phi? phi_0 is the dimensionless film thickness
**for which the thermodynamic parameters** are estimated -> here it should be
identical with phi (the actual value of the column) -> calculate phi_0 from d
and df, like phi!
[] define a function for optimization, e.g. S(d/L, df/d, Tchar_j, \thetachar_j,
DeltaCp_j) = sum_i(sum_j((tR_{meas,i,j}-tR_{calc,i,j})^2)))
[] rewrite new versions of tR-calculation, which are automatic differentiable
[] input data:
    [] what data
    [] format of the data
[] example set of data for the development (6 or more different temperature
programs with at least 5 solutes)
[] which format of thermodynamic parameters ('ABC' or 'T_char, theta_char,
DeltaCp' (K-centric parameters)) 
[] additional parameters, like phase ratio beta, or ration d/L
[] initial estimations for the parameters
